I represent a rigid body, e.g. a moving mass.

I'm just a NativeBoost proxy to an actual cmBody structure from the native library.

Properties:
- mass
- moment of inertia
- position of the center of gravity
- angle, in radians
- velocity at the center of gravity
- angular velocity, in radians per second
- force applied to the body at its center of gravity
- torque applied to the body
